## Installing and Running Project

  - Install required packages and run the python file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

## Overview 

This project aims to simulate a simple solar system with a central star (e.g., the Sun) and multiple orbiting bodies (e.g., planets). Each orbiting body will move in a circular orbit around the central star. The simulation will update the positions of the orbiting bodies over time based on their orbital periods and visualize their orbits. 

## Controls
  - Control timestep by pressing arrow up and arrow down
  - Zoom in and zoom out by scrolling the mouse wheel up and down
  - Show/ Hide the orbit lines by pressing 's'
  - Show/ Hide the distance to the sun by pressing 'd'
